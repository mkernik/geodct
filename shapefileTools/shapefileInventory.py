script name:shapefileInventory.py
input: <directory path>
output: two text file reports "fileList_[directory_name].txt" and "report_[directory_name].txt"

description: This script creates an inventory of files and field names for 
shapefiles in a folder. 
It also: 
-checks file extensions to ensure that all required and recommended files 
    are present
-determines whether the shapefiles have the same spatial reference
-flags shapefiles that are corrupt or cannot be opened
